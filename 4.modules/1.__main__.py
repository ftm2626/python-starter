# if __name__ == "__main__"

# why tho?
# 1. module can be imported and used by other modules

# 2. module can be imported and used by other modules

# python interpreter sets "special variables", one of thich is __name__
# pyghon willl assign the __name__ variables a value of "__main__" if it's the initial module being run
